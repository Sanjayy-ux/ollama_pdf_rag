Loading the PDF File: Start by loading a PDF file using the "UnstructuredPDFLoader" to extract its content.

Splitting PDF Data: Use the "RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter" to divide the extracted PDF data into manageable chunks.

Generating Embeddings: Create embeddings for each chunk of text using "OllamaEmbeddings" to capture semantic information.

Creating a Vector Database: Establish a new vector database using the "from_documents" method of "Chroma". This integrates the segmented PDF chunks and their corresponding Ollama embeddings.

Answering Questions: Utilize the "chain.invoke" method to answer questions based on the updated PDF document. Input a query to retrieve relevant information effectively.
